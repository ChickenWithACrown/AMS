Implement the calender and make sure all the stuff are defined and has the frame and fix the rank/jons so they can add the jobs for the NCO/officers etc so they know what they are doing etc. It should be mm/dd/yy and automaticly add the / when they reach the next thing etc and add funrasers and the money to keep track how much was raised. Communityu service hours and each cadet need 16 hours to pass the class so keep up with that and the job person will input the hours for each stuned and show red if they need more than 10 houes yellow if they need 5 more hours and gree if they are good to go. and ad a system and notification to tell when the next wevent is if it is upcoming within the next 7 days
. And when I add stuff it addedto the Db but it don't supdate the stuff in realtime etc

Failed to create funraiser card:ame `header_frame` is not defined and it is saying there are more stuff then there are like it says there are 2 cadests but in the DB there is only one and it is not showing the cadets etc and add so when you add something you can remove it or edit it etc
